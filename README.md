# CVIQDatabase

## Introduction

CVIQ Database includes 524 compressed images generated from 16 original images. Three popular coding technologies are deployed in the database, which are JPEG, H.264/AVC, and H.265/HEVC, respectively.

The images with names from 1\*n to 11\*n are compressed by JPEG, with names from 12\*n to 22\*n are compressed by AVC, with names from 23\*n to 33\*n are compressed by HEVC, and with names 34\*n are original images.

The CVIQ.mat file contains the MOS for each image.
